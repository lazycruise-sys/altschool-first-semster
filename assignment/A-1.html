    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm a inquisite person who loves to try different things, and almost never completes them. However, I'm a person who is dangerously excited about technology and engineering, and that's an important part of who I am.</p>
    <p>In addition, I love Python, hate JavaScript, and have a lukewarm feeling for SQL.</p>
